# Django Library Management System

A comprehensive web application for managing a book collection, built from scratch using the Django framework. This project demonstrates full-stack development principles, from database modeling and user authentication to front-end design with Bootstrap.

The application serves as a private library where registered users can manage books, organize them into personal collections, and mark their favorites.

## Key Features

* **📚 Full Book Management (CRUD):** Easily **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete books from the library.
* **🔍 Advanced Filtering & Search:** Find books quickly by searching for titles/authors or filtering by a combination of price, publication year, category, and genre.
* **👤 User Authentication:** Secure user registration, login, and logout system. All library features are protected and require users to be logged in.
* **⭐ Personalization Features:**
    * **Favorites:** Users can mark books as favorites for quick access from their profile menu.
    * **Custom Shelves:** Users can create, name, manage, and delete their own personal "shelves" (e.g., "To Read," "Finished," "Sci-Fi Collection") and add books to them.
* **🏷️ Dynamic Categorization:** Books are organized using:
    * **Categories:** Broad, admin-defined classifications (e.g., Fiction, Non-fiction).
    * **Genres:** More specific, admin-defined tags, where a book can have multiple genres (e.g., Fantasy, Adventure).
* **🎨 Clean User Interface:** A responsive and modern UI designed with Bootstrap 5, featuring a user-friendly dashboard and custom-styled authentication pages.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Django
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5
* **Database:** SQLite (Default)

## Project Goal

This project was developed as a practical exercise to build a complete, database-driven web application and implement common features found in modern web apps, reinforcing skills in Django's MVT architecture, ORM, form handling, and user management systems.
